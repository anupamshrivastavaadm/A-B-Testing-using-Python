# A/B Testing using Python

In A/B testing, I compared the outcomes of two marketing approaches to determine which is most effective for next marketing initiatives. For instance, my target market was different from the target market of my second ad campaign when I initially started an Instagram ad campaign to promote my Instagram post. The audience of the second ad campaign was always my preference after comparing the outcomes of the two ads because it had a greater reach and subscriber base than the first.

A/B testing is what it refers to. Your objective may be to increase traffic, sales, or followers, but A/B testing is what we do when we choose the best marketing approach based on the outcomes of our prior marketing campaigns.

We need a dataset on two distinct marketing methods for the same aim in order to perform A/B testing in Python.

Importing the required libraries:

Importing the dataset:

Printing both the data:

Then after preparing the data, checking if it has null values, if any missing rows or values.

After combining the data:

Checking the dataset if both has equal number of samples:

# A/B Testing to Find the Best Marketing Strategy

Before A/B Testing:

Examineing how many searches from each campaign were made on the website:

Now examine how many website clicks each campaign received:

Examine how much content each campaign's visitors viewed once they arrived at the website:

Now examine the number of items that have been added to the cart from both campaigns:

Now examine how much was spent on each campaign:

Now examine the purchases made by the two campaigns:

Now examine some indicators to determine which advertising campaign converts better. I'll start by examining the connection between the quantity of website clicks and the amount of content from both campaigns that was viewed:

Now examine the connection between the quantity of content viewed and the quantity of items added to basket across both campaigns:

Now examine the correlation between the number of items put to the shopping basket and the total number of sales generated by the two campaigns:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118778677/225783511-103b5366-608c-4c19-a87c-53a7a7017b0e.png)

The test campaign has a higher conversation rate even though the control campaign generated more sales and more items in the shopping cart.
